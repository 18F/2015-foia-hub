# Contacts Update Form

### Description
A form modeled after [foia.gov's xmlgen](http://www.foia.gov/xmlgen/) to help Agencies provide us with contact information. The form pre-populates with data from foia_hub so the user only needs to make corrections to the existing data. Once the data is validated, the user is allowed to download a json file with the updated changes and presented with instructions on how to upload the data.

### Usage
Runs as any django app. Eventually, we should be able to combine move this app into foia_hub since it uses the same static files.
