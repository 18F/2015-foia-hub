Section 1614 also requires the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral to submit to the appropriate committees of Congress an interim\nreport, which may include recommendations regarding criminal history\nchecks for individuals that seek to volunteer with organizations that work\nwith children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities.\nThe authority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct\nfingerprint-based criminal history record checks for noncriminal justice\npurposes is derived from Public Law (Pub. L.) 92-544. This law, enacted in\n1972, authorizes the FBI to exchange identification records with officials of\nlocal and state governments for purposes of licensing and employment if\nsuch exchanges are authorized by a state statute that has been approved by\nthe U.S. Attorney General.\nThe FBI and state criminal history record repositories are also\nauthorized to provide criminal history record information (excluding sealed\nrecords) to criminal justice agencies, governmental, and nongovernmental\nagencies for noncriminal justice purposes allowed by federal statute or\nfederal executive order that authorizes national background checks.\nThe majority of criminal history record checks for noncriminal justice\npurposes are conducted by local and state agencies. In Fiscal Year\n(FY) 2009, the FBI received 9.3 million non-federal civil fingerprintsubmissions. States routinely process criminal history record checks for law\nenforcement agencies for approved noncriminal justice purposes; individuals\nrequesting a copy of their own criminal history record; or authorized entities\nfor employment and licensing purposes.\n\n\fEvery state has established policy and procedures for requesting state\nand national criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes.\nThese policies and procedures, which vary from state to state, address topics\nsuch as who can get access to criminal history records and for what purpose;\nwhat information is contained in the record; and the appropriate use and\ndissemination of the information. These poiicies and procedures are\ndesigned to assure the quality, confidentiality, and security of the criminal\nhistory record information. They also help to ensure the information is used\nin a fair and lawful manner.\nThe FBI's, Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division,\ncollected data on the current state of civil fingerprint processing at the\nfederal, state, and local level. The data was collected, in part, from the\nresults of a 2003 survey conducted of administrators of state criminal history\nrecord repositories. The data was updated with information obtained from\nsubsequent surveys and reports, as well as information obtained from state\nwebsites.\nBased on the findings of the study, it was determined that many states\nhave established successful programs for performing criminal history record\nbackground checks on individuals that provide care to children and other\nvulnerable citizens. A preliminary review of the results of the study\nrevealed the following:\n\u2022\n\nAll states have established policies, practices, and standards for\nperforming state and national criminal history record checks for\nnoncriminal justice purposes. In FY 2009, the CJIS Division received\nover 9.3 million civil fingerprint submissions from the 50 states and\nthe District of Columbia.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn FY 2009, 91 percent of all nonfederal civil fingerprint submissions\nwere sent electronically compared to 73 percent in FY 2003.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn general, a state is more likely to participate in a nationwide system\nfor performing criminal history record checks if the system is\nconsistent with the state's existing policies and procedures for\nperforming state and national criminal history record checks; the state\nhas the infrastructure and sufficient capacity to process the\nfingerprints; and the state is authorized to establish and collect a fee\nfor performing the background checks.\n\n\fMany states have developed cost-efficient and effective practices for\nperforming the core components of the criminal history record check\nprocess. Among the best practices adopted by the states are the\nestablishment of privately operated fingerprint centers to provide livescan fingerprint services to applicants and volunteers; the use of a\nsecure web site to disseminate criminal history record information to\nindividuals and authorized recipients; and, the establishment of\nsecurity and confidentiality policies and practices for the collection,\nmaintenance, use, and disclosure of criminal history record\ninformation.\nAs the number of authorized noncriminal justice checks of FBImaintained criminal history record information has grown over the\nyears, many states have turned to the use of private vendors to\nperform some or all aspects of the criminal history background check\nprocess.\nThe use of private vendors to capture and submit fingerprints reduces\nturnaround time and improves fingerprint quality,\nThe extent of state participation in the National Child Protection Act\n(NCPA), as amended by the Volunteers for Children (VCA) Act,\nvaries from state to state. Forty-nine states and the District of\nColumbia have enacted statutes authorizing national fingerprint-based\ncriminal history background checks on one or more categories of\nemployees, licensees, or volunteers who work for organizations that\nprovide care to children.\nAll states have adopted privacy-related policies and practices\nregarding the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of criminal\nhistory record information. These policies and practices include the\nenactment of legislation governing the access to and dissemination of\ncriminal history record information; requirement for qualified entities\nto sign privacy and security agreements; implementation of guidelines\non record retention and dissemination; and performance of security\naudits.\n\n\fBACKGROUND\nOn April 21, 2009, the U.S. President signed into law the \"Edward M.\nKennedy Serve America Act.\" The Act reauthorizes and expands national\nservice programs administered by the Corporation for National and\nCommunity Service. Section 1614 of the Serve America Act directs the\nU.S. Attorney General to conduct a feasibility study on the efficiency and\neffectiveness of local and state criminal history checks, including the\nfollowing information;\nA. The state of criminal history checks, including the use of fingerprint\ncollection, at the state and local level, including the available\ninfrastructure for conducting criminal history checks; the state system\ncapacities to conduct such criminal history checks; and the time\nrequired for each state to process an individual's fingerprints for a\nnational criminal history background check through the FBI, from the\ntime of fingerprint collection to the submission to the FBI.\nB. The likelihood that each state would participate in a nationwide\nsystem of criminal history checks to provide information regarding\nparticipants to entities receiving assistance under the national service\nlaws.\nC. The number of participants that would require a fingerprint-based\nnational criminal history background check under the national service\nlaws.\nD. The impact of the national service laws on the Integrated Automated\nFingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of the FBI in terms of\ncapacity and impact on other users of the system, including the effect\non work practices and staffing levels of the FBI.\nE. The fees charged by the FBI, states, local agencies, and private\ncompanies to collect and process fingerprints and conduct criminal\nhistory checks.\nF. The existence of model or best practice programs regarding\nconducting criminal history record checks that could easily be\nexpanded and duplicated in other states.\n\n\fG. The extent to which private companies are currently performing\ncriminal history checks and the possibility of using private companies\nin the future to perform any of the criminal history check process,\nincluding the collection and transmission of fingerprints and fitness\ndeterminations.\nH. The cost of development and operation of the technology and the\ninfrastructure necessary to establish a nationwide fingerprint-based\nand other criminal background check system.\nI. The extent of state participation in the procedures for background\nchecks under the National Child Protection Act of 1993 (Title 42\nUnited States Code (U.S.C.) 5119 et seq.)J. The extent to which states provide access to nationwide criminal\nhistory record checks to organizations that serve children.\nK. The extent to which states permit volunteers and other individuals to\nappeal adverse fitness determinations, and whether similar procedures\nare required at the federal level.\nL. Any privacy concerns that may arise from nationwide criminal\nbackground checks for participants.\nM. Any other information determined relevant by the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral.\n\n\fSCOPE AND METHODOLOGY\nThis report is based in part upon the results obtained from a survey\nconducted of administrators of state criminal history record repositories in\nMay-July 2003. A total of 53 jurisdictions were surveyed, including the\n50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands. The FBI received responses from 52 (98 percent) of\nthe 53 jurisdictions. The survey consisted of eleven questions, each\npertaining to the procedures established by the state for conducting\nnoncriminal justice background checks. Telephone surveys and face-to-face\ninterviews supplemented the information provided by the mailed surveys as\ndeemed necessary.\nInformation regarding state criminal history record repositories was\nobtained from the Survey of State Criminal History Information Systems,\n2008, which was prepared by The National Consortium for Justice\nInformation and Statistics (SEARCH), in cooperation with the Bureau of\nJustice Statistics. Information was also obtained from official state web sites.\nThe Corporation for National and Community Service (Corporation)\nprovided information on the number of participants that would require a\nnational criminal history record check under the national service laws and\nthe existence of model programs or best practices for performing national\ncriminal history record checks that could be expanded and duplicated in\nother states.\nThe FBI reviewed the list of approved Pub. L. 92-544 state statutes to\ndetermine the extent that the states participate in the National Child\nProtection Act, as amended by the Volunteers for Children Act, and the\nextent to which states provide access to nationwide criminal history\nbackground checks to organizations that serve children and other vulnerable\npopulations.\nBased on the findings of this study and other studies, the CJIS\nDivision will prepare a final report that may include recommendations for\nimproving programs for conducting background checks on volunteers who\nseek to work with organizations that provide care to children, the elderly, or\nthe disabled.\n\n\fFINDINGS\nA. The state of criminal history checks at the state and local level,\nincluding the use offingerprintcollection, at the state and local level,\nincluding the available infrastructure for conducting criminal history\nchecks; the state system capacities to conduct such criminal history\nchecks; and the time required for each state to process an individual's\nfingerprints for a national criminal history background check through\nthe FBI,fromthe time offingerprintcollection to the submission to\nthe FBI.\nTraditionally, states have played an integral and important role in the\nperformance of criminal history record checks for both criminal justice and\nnoncriminal justice purposes. Currently, all states and the District of\nColumbia participate in the electronic exchange of criminal history record\ninformation through the Interstate Identification Index (III) and thirteen\nstates1 participate in the National Fingerprint File (NFF) program. These\nprograms were created to enhance the role of the states in the exchange of\ncriminal history record information. Each state that participates in III or\nNFF is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of its\ncriminal history records, ensuring the security of the record information and\nthe criminal records system, and conducting training on the use and\ndissemination of criminal history record information.\nThe role of the states was further strengthened with the passage of the\nNational Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact2 (Compact) in 1998. The\npurpose of the Compact is to authorize and require party states and the FBI\nto make all unsealed criminal history records available in response to\nauthorized noncriminal justice requests, and to ensure consistency with state\npolicies and procedures. As of October 31, 2009, twenty-eight states3 have\n\n1\n\nThe thirteen NFF stales are Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, New Jersey,\nNorth Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, and Wyoming.\n2\nPub. I. 105-251, 42 U.S.C. 14616.\n3\nThe twenty-eight Compact states are Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia,\nHawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey,\nNevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, West\nVirgina, and Wyoming.\n\n\fratified the Compact and twelve territories and states4 have signed a\nMemorandum of Understanding agreeing to abide by the policies and\nprocedures delineated by the Compact.\nWithin this framework, all states have established policies, practices,\nand standards for performing state and national criminal history record\nchecks for noncriminal justice purposes. In FY 2009, the CJIS Division\nreceived over 9.3 million civil fingerprint submissions from the 50 states and\nthe District of Columbia.\nStates may submit civil fingerprints to the CJIS Division either\nelectronically or by mail. In FY 2009, 91 percent of all nonfederal civil\nfingerprints submissions were sent electronically compared to 73 percent in\nFY 2003. An analysis of the fingerprints submitted in FY 2009 revealed the\nfollowing;\n\u2022\n\nAll fifty states submit at least a portion of their civil fingerprint\nsubmissions to the FBI electronically as compared to thirty-five states\nin FY 2003.\n\n\u2022\n\nForty states submit at least 90 percent of its civil fingerprint\nsubmissions to the FBI electronically as compared to twenty-seven\nstates in FY 2006.\n\nEach state's capacity to perform criminal history record checks\ndepends upon the availability of system capacity and human resources.\nSystem capacity refers to the technical resources, e.g. hardware, software,\nrequired to process the fingerprints in the required time frame. Human\nresources include the number of people it takes to perform the tasks related\nto the criminal history background check process, e.g. fingerprint\nidentification.\nTo determine the current capacity of each state to process fingerprints,\nthe FBI's CJIS Division examined the number of civil fingerprints submitted\nby each state and the District of Columbia in FY 2009.\n\u2022\n4\n\nNine states submitted 25,000 or fewer civil fingerprints.\n\nThe twelve MOU states and territories are American Somoa, Guam, Minois, Kentucky, Mississippi,\nNebraska, New Mexico. North Dakota, Puerto Rico, South Dakota, Vermont, and Virginia.\n\n\f\u2022\n\nTwenty-one states submitted between 25,000 and 100,000 civil\nfingerprints.\n\n\u2022\n\nTen states submitted between 100,000 and 250,000 civil fingerprints.\n\n\u2022\n\nSix states submitted between 250,000 and 500,000 civil fingerprints.\n\n\u2022\n\nFour states and the District of Columbia submitted over 500,000 civil\nfingerprints.\n\nThe amount of time it takes a state to process a fingerprint-based\ncriminal history record check varies widely, depending on the type of\nsubmission. In general, the average processing time for a live-scan\nsubmission is one day. The average processing time for a manual mail-in\nsubmission is five days. The average processing time for a card-scan\nsubmission is ten days5.\nB. The likelihood that each state would participate in a nationwide\nsystem of criminal history checks to provide information regarding\nparticipants to entities receiving assistance under the national service\nlaws.\nThe likelihood that each state would participate in a nationwide\nsystem of criminal history checks to provide information regarding\nparticipants receiving assistance under the national service laws depends on\nthe existence or absence of the following factors:\n\n5\n\n\u2022\n\nThe state is authorized to perform such checks by state or federal law.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe policies and procedures for performing the national criminal\nhistory record checks are consistent with the state's policies and\nprocedures for performing state criminal history record checks.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe states are authorized to establish and collect a fee for performing\nthe state criminal history background checks.\n\nThe Attorney General's Report On Criminal History Background Checks, VS. Department of Justice,\nJune 2006\n\n\f\u2022\n\nThe state has ample staff to perform criminal history record check\nfunctions or the authority to designate a governmental or a\nnon-governmental agency to perform such functions.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe state has the ability to perform fitness determinations or the\nauthority to designate a governmental or nongovernmental agency to\nperform fitness determinations.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe state has the technical infrastructure in place to efficiently and\neffectively collect and process the fingerprints.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe projected volume of fingerprint submissions is within the state's\ncapacity.\n\nIn general, a state is more likely to participate in a nationwide system\nfor performing criminal history record checks if the system is consistent with\nthe state's existing policies and procedures for performing state and national\ncriminal history record checks; the state has the infrastructure and sufficient\ncapacity to process the fingerprints, and the state is authorized to establish\nand collect a fee for performing the background checks.\nIf participation in the nationwide system is not consistent with\nexisting state statutes, policies, or procedures; or it requires the state to\ninvest considerable resources to either establish or enhance its infrastructure\nand capacity to collect and process the checks; and/or the state is unable to\ncollect a fee for performing the background checks, then it is less likely that\na state will participate in the system.\nC. The number of participants that would require a fingerprint-based\nnational criminal history background check under the national service\nlaws.\nOn August 24, 2007, the Corporation published a final rule6 to require\nits grantees to conduct criminal history checks on Senior Companions7 and\nFoster Grandparents8 participants, as well as on AmeriCorps State and\n6\n\n72 Fed. Reg. 48574 (Aug. 24, 2007)\nThe Senior Companions program brings together volunteers age 55 and over with adults in their\ncommunity who have difficulty with the simple tasks of day-to-day living.\n8\nThe Foster Grandparents program connects volunteers age 55 and over with children and young people\nwith exceptional needs.\n\n\fNational9 participants and grant-funded staff in those programs who on a\nrecurring basis, have access to children, persons age 60 and older, or\nindividuals with disabilities. The final rule establishes that, \"Unless the\nCorporation approves an alternate screening protocol and unless prohibited\nor otherwise precluded by State law, a covered grantee must, in selecting an\nindividual for participation, conduct and document two searches: (A) A\nsearch by name or fingerprints of the State criminal registry for the state in\nwhich the program operates and the State in which the applicant resides at\nthe time of the application; and (B) a search of the Department of Justice\nNational Sex Offender Public Registry at http://www.nsopr.gov.\" A grantee\nthat conducts a ftngerprint-based criminal history check through the FBI is\ndeemed to have satisfied the requirement to conduct a criminal history check.\nSection 1612 of the Serve America Act, adds Section 189D, which\nrequires each entity selecting individuals to serve in a position in which\nindividuals receive a living allowance, stipend, national service educational\naward, or salary through a program receiving assistance under the national\nservice laws to, subject to regulations and requirements established by the\nCorporation, conduct criminal history checks for such individuals.\nA criminal history check shall, except in cases approved for good\ncause by the Corporation, include:\n\u2022\n\nA name-based search of the National Sex Offender Registry\nestablished under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of\n200610;and\n\n\u2022\n\nA search of the state criminal registry or repository in the state in\nwhich the program is operating and the state in which the individual\nresides at the time of application; or\n\n\u2022\n\nSubmitting fingerprints to the FBI for a national criminal history\nbackground check.\nSection 1612 effectively expands the coverage of the criminal history\nbackground check to all eligible individuals hired or enrolled in a program\non or after October 1, 2009, regardless of the type of service the individual is\n9\n\nAmeriCorps State and National programs offer grants that support a broad range of local service programs\nthat engage thousands of Americans in intensive service to meet critical community needs.\n10\nPub. L. 109-248\n\n\fperforming or whether or not the individual has access to vulnerable\npopulations.\nThe Serve America Act directs the Corporation to develop a plan to\nincrease ArneriCorps positions to 250,000 by FY 2017. The number of\napproved national service positions authorized by the Serve America Act is:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n2010-88,000\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n2011-115,000\n2012-140,000\n\n\u2022\n\n2013-170,000\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n2014-200,000\n2015-210,000\n\n\u2022\n\n2016-235,000\n\n\u2022\n\n2017-250,000\n\nHowever, Section 1612 does not mandate that a national\nfingerprint-based criminal history check be conducted, but permits the\nentities to perform such a check in lieu of the name-based search of the\nNational Sex Offender Registry and a search of the state criminal repository,\nin order to meet the criminal background check requirement. Therefore, it\nis projected that the actual number of national criminal history record checks\nconducted will be less than the total number of eligible positions.\nSection 1614 further amends Section 189D and includes a provision\nwhich would require a name-based search of the National Sex Offender\nRegistry established under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2006; a search of the state criminal registry or repository in the state in\nwhich the program is operating and the state in which the individual resides\nat the time of application; and a national fingerprint-based criminal history\nrecord check on individuals working with children, the elderly, or\nindividuals with disabilities. This provision goes into effect two years after\nthe date of enactment of the Serve America Act.\nThe requirement to perform a national fingerprint-based criminal\nhistory record check does not apply when the service provided by the\nindividual is episodic in nature or for a one-day period; the cost to the entity\nis prohibitive; the entity is not authorized, or is unable, under state or federal\nlaw, to access the national criminal history background check system, or the\n\n\fCorporation otherwise provides an exemption for good cause. Therefore,\nthe total number of participants that would require a fingerprint-based\nnational criminal history record check under this section is projected to be\nless than the total number of eligible positions.\nD. The impact of the national service laws on the IAFIS of the FBI in\nterms of capacity and impact on other users of the system, including\nthe effect on work practices and staffing levels of the FBI.\nThe impact of the national service laws on IAFIS in terms of capacity\nand impact on other users is dependent on the following factors:\n\u2022\n\nThe actual volume of fingerprints submitted to the FBI under the\nauthority of the national service laws.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe type of fingerprints submitted and the method by which the\nfingerprints are submitted.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe extent to which the national service laws are consistent with the\nFBI's policies, procedures, and business practices for performing\nnational criminal history record checks.\n\nIn general, based on the projected volume of fingerprints that will be\nsubmitted under the national service laws, it is anticipated that the national\nservice laws will have minimal impact on the projected capacity and planned\noperation of IAFIS. However, if the actual volume of fingerprints\nsubmitted to IAFIS exceeds the projected volume, then IAFIS will need to\nbe upgraded to add the capacity to efficiently process the work in a timely\nmanner.\nThe FBI accepts two types of fingerprint images for noncriminal\njustice purposes-rolled and flat. The use of live-scan systems to capture flat\nfingerprints is a fast, high quality, low maintenance alternative to the\ntraditional ink and roll method of capturing fingerprints. However, the\nprocessing of flat fingerprints requires more system resources than the\nprocessing of rolled fingerprint submissions. Therefore, the FBI closely\nmonitors the volume of flat fingerprints submitted to ensure that adequate\nsystem capacity is available to process the fingerprints and to ensure the\nprocessing of criminal submissions is not adversely affected. If the majority\nof fingerprints submitted under the national service laws are flat fingerprints,\n\n\fthen the FBI would need to evaluate the potential impact on the system\ncapacity of the IAFIS.\nIn addition, the FBI's short-range and long range staffing plans are\nbased on the continuance of existing and planned business practices and\nservices. If the national service laws require the FBI to perform additional\nservices, such as record screening or disposition retrieval, then the laws will\nhave a significant impact on the FBI's current work practices and staffing\nlevels.\nE. The fees charged by the FBI, states, local agencies, and private\ncompanies to collect and process fingerprints and conduct criminal\nhistory checks.\nThe FBI's authority for charging fees is found in Pub. L. 101-515. As\nof October 1, 2007, the FBI fee for civil fingerprint-based and name-based\ncriminal history record checks varies, depending on the method of\nsubmission/receipt, as follow:\n\u2022\n\nNonfederal and federal electronic in/electronic out fingerprint-based\ncriminal history record checks - $17.25\n\n\u2022\n\nNonfederal electronic in/manual out fingerprint-based criminal history\nrecord checks - $26.00\n\n\u2022\n\nNonfederal and federal manual in/manual out fingerprint-based\ncriminal history record checks - $30.25\n\n\u2022\n\nVolunteerfingerprint-based(electronic/manual) criminal history\nrecord checks - $13.25\n\nIn 2008, SEARCH conducted a survey of state criminal history\ninformation systems that included state fees for performing background\nchecks. The survey revealed that:\n\u2022\n\nThirty-three states and Guam offer noncriminal justice fingerprintbased criminal history checks at an average cost of $27.10 with\nretention of fingerprints.\n\n\f\u2022\n\nThirty-seven states offer noncriminal justice fingerprint-based\ncriminal history record checks at an average cost of $19.69 without\nretention of fingerprints.\n\n\u2022\n\nTwenty-two states offer noncriminal justice fingerprint-based criminal\nhistory checks for volunteers at an average price of $21.91 with\nretention of fingerprints.\n\n\u2022\n\nThirty-one states offer noncriminal justice fingerprint-based criminal\nhistory checks for volunteers at an average price of $16.23 without\nretention of fingerprints.\n\nIn 2003, the CJIS Division conducted a telephone survey of 406\nrandomly selected law enforcement agencies (a statistically valid sample\nbased on the total number of law enforcement agencies nationwide) to\ndetermine the fee charged for the capture of fingerprints for noncriminal\njustice purposes. The survey revealed that:\n\u2022\n\nTwo hundred and thirteen (70.5 percent) of the 302 respondents\nreported that they provide fingerprint services to the public.\n\n\u2022\n\nOf the 213 law enforcement agencies that reported they provide\nfingerprint services, seventy-one (33 percent) of the agencies charge\napplicants a fee for the capture of fingerprints. Fifty-one (24 percent)\ncharge volunteers a fee for the capture of fingerprints.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe average fee reported for capturing fingerprints was $9. The mode\nfee reported for capturing fingerprints was $5.\n\nMany states use private vendors to capture fingerprints using live-scan\ndevices and submit the fingerprints to the state central repository\nelectronically. The private vendors typically charge the applicant or the\nqualified entity a fee to recover the cost of operating the fingerprint capture\nequipment. The fee ranges from $10 to $20 but could be higher depending\non the level of service provided by the vendor.\nF. The existence of model or best practice programs regarding\nconducting criminal history checks that could easily be expanded and\nduplicated in other states.\n\n\fMany states have developed cost-efficient and effective practices for\nperforming the core components of the criminal history record check process.\nAmong the best practices used by the states are:\n\u2022\n\nThe establishment of privately operated fingerprint centers to provide\nlive-scan fingerprint services to applicants and volunteers.\nThe use of secure web sites to disseminate criminal history record\ninformation to authorized recipients.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe implementation of security and confidentiality guidelines to\nprotect an individual's privacy.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe establishment of a timely process for reviewing and challenging\nthe accuracy and completeness of information contained in an\nindividual's criminal history record.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe retention of fingerprints to facilitate recertifications and to\nprovide \"rap back\" services.\n\nThe use of private vendors to capture and submit fingerprints reduces\nturnaround time and improves fingerprint quality. Most live-scan software\nis designed to perform automatic edits to ensure that all of the mandatory\ndata fields have been completed and the data are in the correct format. The\nsoftware can also determine if a fingerprint image is of sufficient quality for\nsubmission.\nOnce the fingerprints are processed, some states send the response to a\nsecure web site where the applicant or the qualified organization can retrieve\nthe results of the criminal history background check. This process reduces\nresponse time and helps to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the\ninformation because states are able to control who can get access to the\ninformation as well as control what information is available for review.\n\n\fFinally, many states have established civil fingerprint retention\npolicies and procedures arising from the requirement to perform criminal\nhistory record checks on individuals seeking employment or a license.\nRetained fingerprints are used to identify a deceased individual; identify a\nperson in custody; or inform an employer when an individual who has\nundergone a fingerprint-based criminal history record check, as required by\nlaw, is subsequently arrested.\nThe retention of the fingerprints enables the states to establish more\nefficient programs that eliminate the burden and the costs associated with\nperforming multiple background checks and capturing new fingerprints on\nthe same individual. In most cases, an individual's fingerprints are retained\nfor a specific time frame or until the state repository is notified that the\nindividual is no longer employed or licensed in the state.\nCurrently, the FBI retains the fingerprints of some government\nemployees, military personnel, applicants for immigration and naturalization,\nand individuals who have requested that their fingerprints be retained for\nhumanitarian purposes.\nG. The extent to which private companies are currently performing\ncriminal history checks and the possibility of using private companies\nin the future to perform any of the criminal history check process,\nincluding the collection and transmission of fingerprints and fitness\ndeterminations.\nAs the number of authorized noncriminal justice checks of\nFBI-maintained criminal history information has grown over the years,\nmany states have turned to the use of private vendors to perform some or all\naspects of the criminal history background check process, including\nenrollment, fingerprint capture, and billing.\nMany states allow private vendors to contract with authorized\nagencies to capture and submit fingerprints electronically using live-scan\ndevices. Some states have established statewide privately operated\nfingerprint centers to electronically capture and submit fingerprints to the\nstate repository. The use of live-scan devices to capture rolled or flat\nfingerprints and submit them to the state repository improves fingerprint\nquality and reduces response times. Private companies that capture and\n\n\fsubmit fingerprints, but do not review criminal history record information,\nare known as \"channelers.\"\nThe Compact Council published the \"Outsourcing of Noncriminal\nJustice Administrative Functions\" Interim Final Rule (IFR) on December 16,\n2004, with an effective date of December 31,2004 and the Final Rule on\nDecember 15,2005n. The Outsourcing Rule permits private contractors and\ngovernmental agencies to access FBI criminal history record information on\nbehalf of an authorized recipient, pursuant to a contractual agreement and a\nSecurity and Management Control Outsourcing Standard.\nRecognizing the inefficiencies involved in sending fingerprint\nsubmissions to the FBI by mail or electronically by entities not authorized to\nreceive the results of criminal history record checks, the Compact Council\npromulgated the Final Rule whereby the FBI may provide criminal history\nrecord information to private contractors for the administration of\nnoncriminal justice functions.\nThe FBI selected 19 private contractors to serve as channelers for\nnoncriminal justice applicant fingerprint submissions. Currently, fifteen\nFBI-approved contractors serve as channelers. Twelve of the contractors\ncapture and submit fingerprints for federally-insured banking institutions,\npublic housing authorities, and/or the Transportation Security\nAdministration. One of the contractors captures and submits fingerprints for\nthe Pennsylvania Departments of Welfare and Education and Pennsylvania\nBanking Institutions. For the period beginning on November 11, 2007 and\nending on August 31, 2009, the contractors submitted a total of 482,319\nfingerprints to the FBI. The following is a breakdown of the percentage of\nthe total number of submissions from May 2008 through June 2009 by\ncategory:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nChild Care/School Employee\nLicensing - Section 1012 - Hazardous Materials\nAdam Waish Act - Section 153(b)(2)\nOther Employment and Licensing\nAdam Walsh Act - Section 153(b)(1)(A)\nPublic Housing\n\n27%\n24%\n23%\n10%\n6%\n1%\n\n\" See \"Outsourcing of Noncriminal Justice Administrative Functions,\" National Crime Prevention and\nPrivacy Compaci Council, 70 Fed. Reg. 74200 (Dec. 15, 2005)\n\n\f\u2022\n\nRejected\n\n9%\n\nThe Compact Council's Outsourcing Rule also provides for the\nperformance of noncriminal justice administrative functions other than\n\"channeling.\" The Council's Security and Management Control Outsourcing\nStandard (Outsourcing Standard) was published December 15,2005.\nSection 1.13 of the Outsourcing Standard defines noncriminal justice\nadministrative functions as the routine noncriminal justice administrative\nfunctions relating to the processing of criminal history record information, to\ninclude but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\n\nMaking fitness determinations/recommendations.\n\n\u2022\n\nObtaining missing dispositions.\n\n\u2022\n\nDisseminating criminal history record information as authorized by\nfederal statute, Federal Executive Order, state statute approved by the\nU.S. Attorney General.\n\n\u2022\n\nOther authorized activities relating to the general handling, use, and\nstorage of criminal history record information.\n\nAs of September 30, 2009, the FBI Compact Officer has approved 24\nrequests from 13 organizations to outsource the performance of noncriminal\njustice administrative functions other than \"channeling\" by a private\ncompany. The 13 organizations include 3 state repositories, 2 federal\nagencies, and 8 financial institutions. The noncriminal justice administrative\nfunctions outsourced to a private entity include making fitness\nrecommendations, disseminating criminal history record information, and/or\nstoring and disposing of criminal history record information.\nH. The cost of development and operation of the technology and the\ninfrastructure necessary to establish a nationwide fingerprint-based\nand other criminal background check system.\nThe cost to develop and operate a nationwide fingerprint-based system\ndepends on the following factors:\n\n\f\u2022\n\nThe extent to which the system uses the existing state and federal\ninfrastructure to capture and transmit fingerprints.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe extent to which the system is consistent with existing policies,\nprocedures, and business practices for performing state and national\ncriminal history record checks.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe extent to which the FBI can charge a fee to recover the cost of\ndeveloping, maintaining, and operating the system.\n\nIn general, if the system leverages the existing state and federal\ninfrastructure and is consistent with the current business practices for\nperforming state and nationalfingerprint-basedcriminal history record\nchecks, then the costs to develop and operate the system would fall within\nthe current planned budget and fee structure.\nIf the FBI is required to develop new technology or institute new\nbusiness practices, then the cost to develop and operate the system could\nsignificantly exceed the FBI's current planned budget and fee structure.\nI. The extent of state participation in the procedures for background\nchecks under the National Child Protection Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C.\n5119 et seq.).\nThe NCPA13, as amended by the VCA14 urges states to enact\nlegislation pursuant to Pub. L. 92-544 to provide for background checks for\ncertain individuals who will be working with, or providing care to,\nvulnerable segments of the population. The NCPA/VCA encourages states\nto have in effect national background check procedures that require\n\"qualified entities1' designated by the state to contact an \"authorized state\nagency\" to request a nationwide background check on an applicant for the\npurpose of determining whether a \"provider\" is fit to care for the safety and\nwell-being of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities.\nSome states use the NCPA/VCA to submit fingerprint-based\nbackground checks in the absence of a Pub. L. 92-544 state statute. Other\nstates use the NCPA/VCA to supplement existing Pub. L. 92-544 approved\n\n\fstate statutes. For example, a state may use a Pub. L. 92-544 approved state\nstatute to conduct criminal history record checks on school teachers and use\nthe NCPA/VCA as the authority to background school support personnel.\nA review of the Pub. L. 92-544 state statutes that have been approved\nby the CJIS Division revealed that:\n\u2022\n\nForty-nine states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana\nIslands have enacted statutes authorizing national fingerprint-based\ncriminal history background checks on one or more categories of\nemployees, licensees, or volunteers who work for organizations that\nprovide care to children.\n\n\u2022\n\nForty-two states have enacted statutes authorizing national\nfingerprint-based checks on individuals who work with, or provide\ncare to, the elderly.\n\n\u2022\n\nThirty-one states have enacted statutes authorizing national\nfingerprint-based checks on individuals who work with, or provide\ncare to, the individuals with disabilities.\nJ. The extent to which States provide access to nationwide criminal\nhistory record checks to organizations that serve children.\n\nThe extent to which states provide access to nationwide criminal\nhistory record checks to organizations that serve children varies in scope and\ncoverage from state to state.\nForty-nine states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana\nIslands have enacted statutes authorizing national fingerprint-based criminal\nhistory background checks on one or more categories of employees,\nlicensees, or volunteers who work for organizations that provide care to\nchildren. These statutes cover positions such as child care employees and\nvolunteers, school district employees and volunteers, school bus drivers,\npublic and private school teachers, government employees and contractors\nwho have direct access to children, foster parents, adoptive parents, as well\nas employees and volunteers that work for nonprofit organizations that\nprovide care to children.\n\n\fMany states also participate in federal programs that authorize access\nto nationwide criminal history record checks. Thirty-one states participate in\nthe NCPA/VCA program which authorizes qualified entities to request\nnationalfingerprint-basedcriminal history record checks on individuals that\nwork with children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities.\nIn addition, sixteen states and the District of Columbia are submitting\nfingerprints to the FBI under the authority of the Adam Walsh Child\nProtection and Safety Act of 2006 which authorizes child welfare agencies\nto conduct criminal history record checks on prospective foster or adoptive\nparents and also authorizes public or private elementary or secondary\nschools or local or state educational agencies to conduct checks on current or\nprospective employees or individuals in positions that work with or around\nchildren in the school or agency.\nK. The extent to which slates permit volunteers and other individuals to\nappeal adversefitnessdeterminations, and whether similar procedures\nare required at the federal level.\nThe FBI has established a procedure pursuant to 28 C.F.R. 16.33 et\nseq. by which a record subject can obtain a copy of his criminal history\nrecord and challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information\ncontained in the record. The states must have similar procedures in place\npursuant to 28 C.F.R. 20.21(g). Consistent with such regulatory obligations,\na state may have either formal or informal procedures by which appeals\nconcerning state records can be made. In addition, most states entitle each\nindividual who is the subject of a criminal history record check to obtain a\ncopy of their criminal history record report and to challenge the accuracy\nand completeness of the criminal history record information on the report.\nThe specific procedures for appealing an adverse determination\nshould be established by the agency making the suitability determination.\nThe reviewing agency should provide the applicant with the reason for the\ndetermination and copy of the procedures for appealing the determination, in\nwriting, at the time of the determination.\n\n\fL. Any privacy concerns that may arise from nationwide criminal\nbackground checks for participants.\nThe private sector and nongovernmental agencies have received\ngreater access to state and federal criminal history records. Policymakers\nmust balance the benefits of screening individuals that work with vulnerable\ncitizens with the individual's right to privacy. The dissemination of an\nindividual's criminal history record information raises concerns regarding\nthe misuse of an individual's personally identifiable information, the\nauthorized use or dissemination of an individual's criminal history record\ninformation, or the dissemination of inaccurate or incomplete criminal\nhistory information. Because criminal history record check procedures\nrequire applicants to disclose personally identifiable information, such as\nfull name, date of birth, and social security number, entities need to be aware\nof the potential for identity theft.\nTo minimize the risks associated with the dissemination of an\nindividual's criminal history record information, all states have adopted\nsecurity and confidentiality policies and practices for the collection,\nmaintenance, use, and disclosure of criminal history record information.\nThese policies and practices include the enactment of legislation governing\nthe access to and dissemination of criminal history record information;\nrequiring qualified entities to sign privacy and security agreements;\nimplementing guidelines on record retention and dissemination; and\nperforming security audits.\nClosely related to privacy requirements are state and federal laws that\nprohibit the discrimination in employment such as Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) oversees and coordinates all federal equal employment opportunity\nregulations, practices, and policies. The EEOC suggests that prospective\nemployers should weigh the following factors when considering an applicant\nfor employment:\n\u2022\n\nThe nature and gravity of the offense.\n\n*\n\nThe time that has passed since the conviction or completion of the\nsentence.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe nature of the position sought.\n\n\fMany states have also passed equal employment opportunity laws\naimed at regulating the use of criminal history record information by\nemployers. Some states have statutes that prohibit discrimination of\nindividuals with criminal records.\nThe FBI has established a procedure whereby an individual can obtain\na copy of his/her criminal history record to review for accuracy and\ncompleteness. Further, 28 C.F.R. 50.12 requires officials making\nemployment and licensing determinations to provide the applicant the\nopportunity to complete or challenge the accuracy of the information\ncontained in the FBI identification record. The regulation provides that\nofficials making such determinations should not deny the license or\nemployment based upon information in the record until the applicant has\nbeen afforded a reasonable time to correct or complete the record.\nM. Any other information determined relevant by the Attorney General.\nIn April 2003, the President signed into law the Prosecutorial\nRemedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today\n(PROTECT) Act. The act directed the U.S. Attorney General to establish a\npilot program for volunteer groups to obtain national and state\nfingerprint-based criminal history record checks. The purpose of the pilot\nprogram is to evaluate the feasibility of establishing a nationwide program\nfor performingfingerprint-basedcriminal history record checks on\nindividuals that work with children. The pilot program began on July 29,\n2003, and is scheduled to continue until January 30, 2010\nAny volunteer organization that is a member of the National\nMentoring Partnership, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the National\nCouncil of Youth Sports, or is a nonprofit organization that provides care to\nchildren may participate in the PROTECT Act pilot program. Eligibility for\nparticipation in the pilot program is determined by the National Center for\nMissing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), with the concurrence or\nrejection of the Attorney General. In addition to the organizations identified\nthe above, the following organizations have been approved to participate in\nthe pilot program:\n\n\f\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nNational Alliance for Youth Sports\nPalouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute\nAmerican Camp Association\nNational Crime Prevention Council\nAssociation of Missing and Exploited Children Organizations\nNCMEC (community outreach volunteers)\nSuffolk Humane Society, Humane Education Program\n\nParticipating agencies are required to send their fingerprint cards to\nthe NCMEC which scans the fingerprints and submits them to the FBI\nelectronically. The FBI sends the results of the criminal history record\ncheck to the NCMEC which makes the determination whether the\ninformation contained in the criminal history record renders the volunteer\nunfit to provide care to children. The NCMEC and the volunteer\norganizations agreed that any individual who has been convicted for any of\nfollowing offenses will be considered unfit to provide care to children;\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nAll felonies.\nAny lesser crime for which sexual relations is an element (including\npornography).\nAny lesser crime involving cruelty to animals.\nAny lesser crime involving controlled substances (including Driving\nUnder the Influence which may involve drugs).\nAny lesser crime involving force or threat of force against a person.\n\nAs of October 30, 2009, the NCMEC processed 77,213 criminal\nhistory background checks. As a result, it was determined that 3,298\nindividuals may not meet the criteria to volunteer with children, and 1,409\nindividuals did not meet the criteria to volunteer with children. The crimes\ncommitted by the individuals who did not meet the criteria to volunteer with\nchildren include attempted murder, rape, sexual assault, sexual contact with\na child, and assault with a deadly weapon.\nThe PROTECT Act entitles each volunteer who is subject to a\ncriminal history background check under the pilot program to contact the\nU.S. Attorney General to (1) obtain a copy of their criminal history record\nreport; and (2) challenge the accuracy and completeness of the criminal\nhistory record information in the report.\n\n\fEach volunteer that is subject to a background check may request the\nrelease of their criminal history record by completing a release form and\nsubmitting the form to the CJIS Division. The volunteer must include the\nfollowing information on the release form: name and date of birth of the\nvolunteer, name of the national organization, name of the local organization,\nOriginating Agency Identifier; and the IAFIS transaction control number. A\nnotary public must witness the completion of the release form and sign it for\nverification.\nThe volunteer may request the FBI to send a copy of his criminal\nhistory record to him or to the local volunteer organization. If the criminal\nhistory record is disseminated to the local volunteer organization, then the\nlocal volunteer organization may provide the volunteer with a copy of his\nrecord. As of November 21,2009 the FBI received 1,489 requests for\ncriminal history record information.\nBased on the results of the PROTECT Act pilot program, the FBI will\nsubmit a final report to Congress that may include recommendations for\nimproving programs for conducting criminal history record checks on\nindividuals that provide care to children, the elderly, or individuals with\ndisabilities.\n\n\fCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nThis report examined: (I) the current state of civil fingerprint\nprocessing at the local, state, and federal level; and (2) the feasibility of\nperformingfingerprint-basedcriminal history background checks on\nindividuals that participate in national service programs.\nBased on thefindingsof this report, the FBI concludes that it is\nfeasible to performfingerprint-basedcriminal history record checks on\nindividuals that participate in national service programs. Many states have\nestablished effective programs for supporting fingerprint-based criminal\nhistory record checks for noncriminal justice purposes, such as employment\nand licensing. The majority of state and national criminal history record\nchecks are authorized by state statutes and are conducted in conformance\nwith the state policies, practices, and procedures.\nIn the absence of state statutes, many states use federal laws, such as\nthe NCPA, as amended by the VCA and the Adam Walsh Child Protection\nand Safety Act of 2006, to perform state and national criminal history record\nchecks on individuals who work with children, the elderly, or individuals\nwith disabilities.\nThe FBI acknowledges that the state repository is the most complete\nand accurate source of criminal history record information within the state.\nFurthermore, since states maintain records that are not available at the\nnational level, e.g. sex offender records that do not qualify for entry into the\nNational Sex Offender Registry file and arrests and dispositions not reported\nto the FBI, they have more information to identify individuals who may be\nunsuitable to work in a particular job.\nTherefore, it is recommended that any system for performing\nfingerprint-based criminal history record checks on individuals that\nparticipate in national service programs encourage the submission of\nfingerprints through the state repository, and that a state criminal history\nrecord check be performed, to the extent possible, prior to the request for a\nnational criminal history record check.\nIn order to encourage as many states as possible to participate, it is\nrecommended the system include the following provisions:\n\n\f\u2022\n\nThe states should be able to perform state and national criminal\nhistory record checks in accordance with their existing policies,\npractices, and standards.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe states should be authorized to designate a governmental or\nnongovernmental entity to conduct fitness determinations.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe states should be authorized to establish and collect fees to recover\nthe full costs, including direct and indirect costs, of processing\nbackground checks.\n\nIt is recommended that the system leverage existing state and federal\ninfrastructures and be operated consistent with the current business practices\nfor performing state and national fingerprint-based criminal history record\nchecks.\n\n\fAppendix A: Child-Care Related Statutes, by State\nState\nAlabama\n\nAlaska\n\nState Statute\n\nApplicants for adoption or foster parents\n\nAct No. 99-361\n\nEducational personnel or teacher certification\n\nAkS\u00a7l2.62.I60(e|\n\nEmployment involving supervisor)- or disciplinary power over minors.

NUMBERS OF MOZAMBICANS ARE GROWING AND\nTHERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF RECOGNITION THAT THESE ARE\nIN FACT REFUGEES WHO MAY BE IN ZIMBABWE FOR SOME\nTIME WITH A CONSEQUENT SHIFT IN APPROACH TO\nASSISTANCE. NEW SOUTH AFRICAN REFUGEES ARE STILL\nNOT LIKELY TO BE WELCOME. THE SITUATION IN\nMATABELELAND HAS IMPROVED FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS\nPERSPECTIVE AND RETURNING ZIMBABWEANS SEEM TO BE\nEXPERIENCING NO DIFFICULTIES IN THE MAIN. GOZ\nWOULD LIKE TO COORDINATE/CONTROL NGOS MORE CLOSELY.\nEND SUMMARY.\n\nMOZAMBICANS\n\n2. (LOU) OF THE 46,000 MOZAMBICANS ESTIMATED TO HAVE\nBEEN PRESENT IN EASTERN ZIMBABWE IN 1984 AND FOR\nWHOM FOUR CAMPS WERE SET UP, ONLY 15,000 ACTUALLY\nMOVED TO THE CAMPS. GOZ ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE\nCONFIDENTIAL\nPAGE 03\n\nHARARE 02506 01 OF 05 021131Z\n\nNOW 24,000 IN THE CAMPS, WITH THE INCREASE (AT THE\nRATE OF 1,000 PER MONTH) BEING MAINLY IN NEW ARRIVALS\nFROM MOZAMBIQUE RATHER THAN IN MOVEMENTS OF SPONTANEOUSLY SETTLED MOZAMBICANS OF WHOM THERE ARE MANY,\nINCLUDING TRADITIONAL SEASONAL LABORERS. UNHCR\nBELIEVES THAT WITH SOME ADDITIONAL LAND AND\nINFRASTRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS, THE PRESENT FOUR\nCAMPS CAN ACCOMMODATE UP TO 40,000 PEOPLE. GOZ\nWOULD LIKE TO OPEN A FIFTH CAMP (FIVE WERE ORIGINALLY\nFORESEEN), BUT THE SITE PROPOSED IS ARID AND\nUNACCEPTABLE TO UNHCR.\n3. (U) CAMPS ARE RUN BY THE GOZ WITH SERVICES\nPROVIDED THROUGH RESOURCES OF UNHCR AND NGOS.\nTHE NUMBER OF NGOS INVOLVED IS DROPPING BECAUSE OF\nLACK OF FINANCING AND, ACCORDING TO THE MORE CYNICAL,\nBECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS NO LONGER IN THE NEWS. ON\nTHE OTHER HAND, ZIMBABWE IS BLESSED WITH RELATIVELY\nSTRONG DONOR SUPPORT SO UNHCR IS ABLE TO BROKER NGO\nINPUTS WHILE DECREASING ITS OWN BUDGET FOR SOME\nASPECTS. (N.B. UNHCR IS NOT/NOT AN IMPLEMENTOR\nNOR DOES IT HAVE IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS IN ZIMBABWE.\nIT IS SUPPORTING GOZ EFFORTS.)\n4. (U) FOOD IS PROVIDED FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES,\nINCLUDING WFP. GOZ IS ABOUT TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL\nWFP COMMODITIES. RUFUGEES COOK COMMUNALLY AND DO\nSOME VEGETABLE FARMING COMMUNALLY AS WELL. DIET\nINCLUDES CORN MEAL, BEANS, FISH, AND VEGETABLES.\nCAMPS ARE DIVIDED INTO SOCIALLY COHESIVE VILLAGES,\nGROUPING PEOPLE FROM SIMILAR AREAS OF ORIGIN AND\nHAVING ELECTED/SELECTED COMMITTEES TO REPRESENT THEM.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2012-29009 Doc No. C05256973 Date: 09/24/2013\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2012-29009 Doc No. C05256973 Date: 09/24/2013\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPAGE 01\nHARARE 02506 02 OF 05 021132Z\nACTION RP-10\nINFO LOG-00 COPY-01 ADS-00 AID-00 AF-00 H-01 10-17\nCOME-00 HA-09 L-03 TRSE-00 INSE-01 VO-06 OMB-01\nCA-02 AGR-01 SR-06 /058 W\n072211 021227Z /51\nR 021121Z MAY 86\nFM AMEMBASSY HARARE\nTO SECSTATE WASHDC 0743\nINFO AMEMBASSY LUSAKA\nAMEMBASSY MAPUTO\nAMEMBASSY GABORONE\nAMEMBASSY LILONGWE\nAMEMBASSY MBABANE\nUSMISSION GENEVA\nCONFIDENTIAL SECTION 02 OF 05 HARARE 02506\nE.0.12356: DECL:OADR\nTAGS: PREF, ZI\nSUBJECT: ZIMBABWE REFUGEE AFFAIRS UPDATE\nHEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED BY MOH PERSONNEL AS WELL AS\nSOME REFUGEE PERSONNEL WITH CLINIC BUILDINGS AND\nSUPPLIES PROVIDED BY UNHCR AND NGOS. (CHOLERA AND\nTYPHOID HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN AT LEAST ONE CAMP.)\nSHELTER AND SANITATION FACILITIES ARE PROVIDED BY\nUNHCR AND NGO RESOURCES. PRIMARY EDUCATION IS TO\nBE SUPPORTED BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, BUT HERETOFORE HAS BEEN ASSURED BY NGOS WORKING WITH AND\nTRAINING REFUGEE TEACHERS. NGOS ALSO PROVIDE PRESCHOOL, ADULT LITERACY, AND SKILLS TRAINING. IN\nKEEPING WITH THE ZIMBABWEAN PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATIONAL\nPRODUCTION, SCHOOL CHILDREN PLANT GARDENS AND LEARN\nVOCATIONAL SKILLS. SOME SERVICES VARY FROM CAMP TO\nCAMP DEPENDING UPON THE PROVIDERS. FOR EXAMPLE,\nSCF/USA AGRESSIVELY PURSUES INCOME GENERATION THROUGH\nCONFIDENTIAL\nPAGE 02\n\nHARARE 02506 02 OF 05 021132Z\n\nADULT SKILLS TRAINING IN CARPENTRY, METAL WORKING,\nBASKETRY, SHOE MAKING, POTTERY, BLACKSMITHING, AND\nBRICK MAKING. THE PRODUCTION GROUPS MAKE EQUIPMENT\nFOR THE CAMPS (E.G., SCHOOL BENCHES AND STRUCTURES)\nAND SELL IN A RAPIDLY DEVELOPING MARKET WITH\nSURROUNDING ZIMBABWEAN VILLAGES. VVVRO, ON THE OTHER\nHAND, DISCOURAGES INCOME GENERATION BECAUSE IT FEARS\nTHAT VOLUNTEER TEACHERS, COOKS, AND TOILET CLEANERS\nWOULD THEN WANT WAGES WHICH ASSISTANCE AGENCIES ARE\nNOT IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2012-29009 Doc No. C05256973 Date: 09/24/2013\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2012-29009 Doc No. C05256973 Date: 09/24/2013\n\n5. (LOU) IN GENERAL, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT ASSISTANCE\nIS RELATIVELY ADEQUATE IN THE CAMPS THOUGH ICRC\n(PROTECT) REPORTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN UNNECESSARY\nMALNUTRITION AMONG CHILDREN, AT LEAST AT ONE POINT\nIN TIME, AND OPINED THAT UNHCR DID NOT PROVIDE\nADEQUATE OVERSIGHT. UNHCR CURRENTLY VISITS THE\nCAMPS ONCE A MONTH.\n6. (C) THE CAMPS ARE WELL ON THEIR WAY TO BECOMING\nSETTLEMENTS. UNHCR HAS PLANNED THIS FROM THE BEGINNING,\nAND THE 1987 PROPOSED PROGRAM WILL BE LOCAL INTEGRATION,\nI.E., UNDER THE GENERAL PROGRAM RATHER THAN BEING A\nSPECIAL PROGRAM. WHILE THERE IS STILL A GREAT\nSENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF THE GOZ TO LABELLING THE\nMOZAMBICANS \"REFUGEES,\" MANY, INCLUDING THE COMMISSIONER\nFOR REFUGEES, SOMETIMES REFER TO THE MOZAMBICANS AS\nREFUGEES IN ADDITION TO USING THE OFFICIAL \"DISPLACED\nMOZAMBICAN\" RUBRIC. IN PARLIAMENT IN RECENT DAYS, THE\nPRIME MINISTER RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS FROM PARLIAMENTARIANS FROM THE AFFECTED REGIONS BY ACKNOWLEDGING\nTHAT CONDITIONS IN MOZAMBIQUE WOULD NOT PRESAGE AN\nEARLY REPATRIATION OF THESE PEOPLE. ONE NGO SOURCE\nCONFIDENTIAL\nPAGE 03\n\nHARARE 02506 02 OF 05 021132Z\n\nREPORTED THAT THE ZIMBABWE MILITARY HAD ROUNDED UP\nMOZAMBICANS AND DEPOSITED THEM BACK IN MOZAMBIQUE\nDURING SEVERAL WEEKS IN DECEMBER 1985/JANUARY 1986,\nBUT SOON GAVE UP AS THE MOZAMBICANS INVARIABLY MADE\nTHEIR WAY BACK ACROSS.\n7. (LOU) THERE HAS BEEN SOME TENSION BETWEEN REFUGEES\nAND LOCAL RESIDENTS AS A RESULT OF THE CAMPS BEING\nPROVIDED WITH SERVICES NOT GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO\nTHE LOCALS. SCF/USA REPORTS THAT IT HAS EXPANDED\nITS SKILLS TRAINING ACTIVITIES TO THE SURROUNDING\nVILLAGES AND IS BEGINNING A CHILD SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM\nTO FINANCE THIS. THE COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES\nDESCRIBED THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CLINICS TO SCREEN\nMOZAMBICANS WHO ARE IMPORTING DISEASES AND FOR\nADDITIONAL CLASSROOMS AS BEING CONSISTENT WITH\nICARA II. THE COMMISSIONER ALSO MADE A PITCH FOR\nBILATERAL USG ICARA II FUNDS AS OPPOSED TO WORKING\nTHROUGH UNDP. WHEN THE COMMISSIONER'S REFERENCE TO\nICARA II WAS DISCUSSED WITH UNDP AND UNHCR, BOTH\nPOINTED OUT THAT ZIMBABWE HAD MORE OR LESS SCOFFED\nAT THE 1984 CONFERENCE AND THAT OFFICIAL GOZ POLICY\nON MOZAMBICANS WAS NOT NEAR THE POINT OF EMBARKING\nON AN ICARA II PROCESS.\n8.

Its political\nimpact, both real and potential, is growing, but the concept is not without controve sy. Critics of the\nterm argue that it frequently evokes negative images of public life that are elusive, \u2022 therworldly, and\neven threatening. Western observers and Arab elites often reserve the notion for p 11111 ulations deemed\ntoo poor or uninformed to require consideration of their views. Others use \"the stre t\" to distinguish\nbetween governments and their people, but those holding both viewpoints agree th t Arab attitudes are\ncomplex and not well understood. Events surrounding September 11 underscore th s conclusion.\n(C) The street can be divided into three broad groupings. The first is composed of e upper echelon of\nsociety--leading journalists, the intelligentsia, business professionals, political and ilitary figures, etc.\nIslamists constitute a second grouping. The third category consists of the masses i the middle--the\naverage Arab men and women who make up the largest component of the street.\n\u2022 The street, moreover, refers to urban rather than rural, peasant populations, hose numbers\noutweigh their political significance in many Arab countries.\n(U) The Arab street in past crises\n(C) Although anti-US and anti-Western sentiment has manifested itself in a nu ber of ways, public\nexpressions of discontent have rarely posed a serious challenge to regime stabili \u2022\n(U) The 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars 2E\u00a9\n7k.C:-1\n1\n'\n\nREVIEW AUTHORITY: Sharon Ahmad, Senior Reviewer\n\nhttp://www.jac.eucom.smil.mil/archive/2002/08/20020819-1807-GEN-SCOL-The Arab ... 12/13/2012\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2007-02501 Doc No. C05328448 Date: 04/24/2013\n\n\fUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2007-02501 Doc No. C05328448 Date: 04/24/2013\n' MIDDLE EAST/NORTH AFRICA The Arab Street (U)\nPage 2 of 3\n\n(C) The 1967 war was a stunning defeat for Jordan, Egypt, and Syria, and a signifi ant victory for\nIsrael. But during this period Egypt and Syria, both closer to the USSR than the U were allied against\nthe United States. Thus there was little friction between government postures and p blic attitudes\ntoward America, which was considered the source of numerous grievances. The C \u2022 ld War continued to\nshape the environment during the 1973 war, when Egypt's \"victory\" against Israel as followed by an\nArab oil boycott against the United States that produced a crippling world economi crisis--a turn of\nevents that only buoyed Arab publics.\n(U) The Gulf war, 1990-91\n(S//NF) Observers expressed concern that the Arab street would erupt in response t US military action\nagainst Saddam Hussein a decade ago, toppling moderate Arab allies and jeopardi ng US foreign\npolicy objectives. But events did not unfold in this way. In addition, poll results du ing the war showed\nwide diversity in popular Arab attitudes toward the crisis; few publics responded i a fashion seriously\ndamaging to Arab regimes identified with US policies. Two factors account for thi\no The marriage of government policy and public opinion. Arab governmen s' support of or\nopposition to the anti-Saddam coalition largely reflected the preferences o their publics. This\nconvergence of public opinion and official policy meant regimes were well s tuated to counter\nany pressure or potential opposition. For example, in Egypt and many Gulf c untries publics and\nleaderships were relatively united in their endorsement of the anti-Saddam c alition. But where\ngovernment stances diverged from public opinion, leaders revised policies til they were\nconsistent with popular sentiment. In Jordan, King Hussein opted out of coal tion participation\nfollowing large, public anti-coalition demonstrations. After massive protests stimated at 300,000\npeople, coalition-member Morocco requested that its military contingent in audi Arabia not be\nused in combat. Publics in Tunisia and Algeria also disapproved. In respons these governments\ncondemned the Iraqi invasion but reserved their sharpest denunciations for t e US-backed\nendeavor and assumed distinctly low profiles in the campaign.\no The \"myth\" of Saddam Hussein. Muted Arab reactions to the Gulf war\nto the fact that Saddam was not as popular as some observers believed, wa\nhumiliatingly defeated, and never attained the pan Arab hero status many\nArab publics opposed to the coalition found Saddam objectionable.
