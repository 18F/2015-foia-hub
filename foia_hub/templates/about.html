    <h2>About this Project</h2>

    <p>
      The Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, has granted the public the right to access information from the Federal government. This process requires the public to submit a request for information or records with a specific Federal agency. The goal of this project is to improve the FOIA request experience by developing a digital tool for people - the people who make requests and the people who administer them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is one of a number of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/us_national_action_plan_6p.pdf">commitments</a> towards modernizing the Freedom of Information Act. We are currently in the <a href="https://18f.github.io/dashboard/stages/">alpha</a> stage of development.
    </p>

    <p>
      This product is meant to compliment the other platforms available. We will publish data that can be leveraged more broadly and continually look to improve the request experience for our users while identifying areas to improve the FOIA intake process for our government partners. What this product does <em>not</em> do is provide a system for agencies to process their FOIA requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we continue, we look forward to informing you of how our project is progressing. We are working on a beta version of our <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-hub">FOIA request intake hub</a>. Please follow along at our main <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia">FOIA project homepage</a>, give us feedback or contribute, and look for more updates in the future.
