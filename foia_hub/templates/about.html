                <h2>openFOIA aims to improve the FOIA request experience.</h2>

                <p> The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants the public
                (everyone!) the right to access information from the Federal
                Government. The FOIA process requires members of the public to
                submit requests for information or records from a specific federal
                agency. If the requested information is able to be shared publicly,
                the agency will grant access to the requested records.  </p>

                <p>openFOIA is an online tool to guide users to up-to-date FOIA
                contact and request information across the federal government. It
                is a work in progress by <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>. The
                data we display is accurate to the best of our knowledge.</p>

                <h3>Getting better all the time</h3>

                <p> Our work is one of several initiatives currently in progress to
                modernize the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

                <p> We're currently in the <a
                href="https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/stages/">alpha</a> stage of
                development, which means are site might not have every feature
                you're looking for.</p>

                <p>Please let us know what's working and what you'd like to see in
                the future - we're actively improving openFOIA, and we base our
                improvements on feedback from users like you! Email your
                suggestions to <a
                href="mailto:18f-foia@gsa.gov">18f-foia@gsa.gov</a>, or visit our
                <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-hub/issues">issue tracker

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fa fa-phone"></span><h3>Up-to-date contact information</h3>
                        <p> openFOIA consolidates the contact information for all
                        federal agencies’ and components’ FOIA offices. It’s easy
                        to search, and it provides links to each agency’s online
                        FOIA request form (when available), allowing users to start
                        their requests more quickly. </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="fa fa-search"></span><h3>Search</h3>
                                <p>It’s not always easy navigating the government’s
                                hierarchy to find where to submit a FOIA request. openFOIA
                                provides different search options to help requesters
                                navigate to the appropriate agency or office within.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h3>Keyword Search</h3>

                                <p>openFOIA lets you search by keyword, which is helpful if
                                you’re not sure which agency to contact. For example, a
                                search for 'benzene' brings up the Environmental Protection
                                Agency, and a search for 'criminal laws' brings up the
                                Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h3> Acronym Search </h3>

                                <p>Some agencies are better known by their acronyms.
                                openFOIA allows users to search by acronym instead of full
                                agency (or component) title. For example, a search for
                                'FBI' brings up the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <h3><span class="fa fa-book"></span>FOIA Libraries</h3>

                        <p>Many agencies provide commonly requested responsive
                        documents in online libraries or reading rooms. openFOIA
                        links to these libraries, letting users see if the
                        information they want is already available.</p>
