        <h1><em>What is FOIA?</em></h1>

        <p>The U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, for short) allows all
        people the right to request access to government records.</p>

        <p>Under FOIA, government agencies are required to disclose requested
        information unless it falls under a specific set of exemptions or
        exclusions.</p>

        <h1><em>How does the process work?</em></h1>
        <ol class="default">

          <li>You (the requester) submit a FOIA request to the agency you
            think has the information you seek.</li>

          <li>In most cases, FOIA officials at that agency will confirm (via
            email) receipt of your request and begin looking for the records
            you requested.</li>

          <li>If your requested records are already publicly available, FOIA
            officials will usually let you know and point you in the right
            direction.</li>

          <li>As FOIA officials collect your requested records, they'll
            evaluate the material to determine what they can send to you.</li>

          <li>FOIA officials will send you the materials they're legally able
            to share. The records you receive may be in full, partial or
            redacted. In some cases, your request may be denied.</li>
