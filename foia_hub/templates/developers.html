<h1> Developers </h1>

<p>
Hello!
</p>

<p>
This effort is a work in progress by <a href=https://18f.gsa.gov/"">18F</a>.
However, we welcome contributions, suggestions and comments by everyone.
</p>

<h2> Technology </h2>

<p>
FOIA Hub is a Python/Django application. Many of the scripts written to collect
data are also written in Python.
</p>


<h2> API </h2>

All of the information presented is available through an API.

<ul>
    <li> <a href="http://foia-hub.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">API documentation</a> </li>
</ul>

<h2> Bulk Data </h2>

<p>
The data source for the API and the tool is a set of YAML files that contain
all the data. These files are the canonical source for our data and are updated
through a combination of automated and manual processes.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia/tree/master/contacts/data">YAML data files</a> </li>
</ul>

<h2> Repositories </h2>

<ul>
    <li>
    <span class="fa fa-github"></span> <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia">foia</a>
    Our main repository (also contains the bulk data)
    </li>

    <li>
    <span class="fa fa-github"></span> <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-hub">foia-hub</a>
    The repository for FOIA Hub.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2> Data Sources </h2>

<p> We use a number of data sources for the information we display about each
component of the government.  </p>

<p> Our contact and processing times data comes from a combination of <a
href="http://foia.gov">foia.gov</a> sources and manually determined data.
Descriptions and acronyms come from a <a href="http://www.usa.gov">usa.gov</a> API.
We populate they keyword search terms using the <a
href="https://www.federalregister.gov/">Federal Register</a> API. Finally, the
FOIA library links are scraped from each agency's FOIA web page where relevant.
</p>

<p> Our <a
href="https://github.com/18F/foia/blob/master/contacts/README.md">source
code</a> provides more information and details on how each data source is
processed.  </p>
