## FOIA Docs

This folder contains doc that can be build using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html).

 To view the docs, run the following commands:
```
pip install sphinx
```

From inside the docs folder:
```
make html
```

The Makefile will build the docs in the build directory. Once it is completely, you can preview the docs by visiting `build/html/index.html` in your browser.
