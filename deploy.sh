# Zero downtime deploy script for foia-hub.
#
# Deploys a new version of the foia app, then once that works,
# flips the route to point at the new version.
#
# The old version of the app stays around and can be reverted to
# by running map-route and unmap-route.
#
# Modeled after http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html
# and https://github.com/dlapiduz/fugacious/blob/master/cf-deploy.sh
